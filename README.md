# Django-Restaurant-API-Project
This is an API project for the LittleLemon restaurant made with Django Rest Framework.

## Project Description
Little Lemon's management wants to develop an online-based order management system and mobile application. They need a back-end API that allows customers to 
- browse food items, 
- view the item of the day and 
- place orders. 
- Managers need to be able to update the item of the day and monitor orders and assign deliveries. - And the delivery crew should be able to check the orders assigned to them and update an order once itâ€™s delivered.
